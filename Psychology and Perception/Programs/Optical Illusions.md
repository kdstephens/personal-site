# Talking About Optical Illusions

Sometime in late 2023, I applied to be a "performer" for the Los Angeles Public Library (see [here](https://www.lapl.org/about-lapl/perform-lapl)). I proposed an educational program based around optical illusions &mdash; *Seeing is Believing: Fun with Optical Illusions*.  I would explain how the eye works and present several illusions related to depth, light, and color. It would be fun. All ages welcome. I wouldn't use screens. 

I got booked for my first performance in May, 2024. I  have since done several more at libraries around Los Angeles. 

Of all the academic and creative pools I dip my toes in, I enjoy this one most. Maybe you could come sometime?
