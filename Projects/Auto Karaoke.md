For this project, I built a tool that takes song audio as input and automatically generates the lyrics as text. The user can then freely edit the text and the corrected lyrics are used to automatically generate a karaoke-style lyric video for the song. 

This project was for a client, so the code is not publicly available, but there is a demo below. 

I built the demo using Streamlit and shared it using a RunPod HTTP service link (see [[Using Streamlit with RunPod]])
