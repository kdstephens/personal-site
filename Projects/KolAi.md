[KolAi](https://kolaidenim.com/) was a company I founded in 2021 with two colleagues (Aydin Tuna Palabiyikoglu and Jack Payne). We provided software for denim designers and manufacturers that would take in an image of a target denim garment and automatically extract a "dry process template" that could be used to replicate the finishing on the garment with a laser etching machine. 

The technology was acquired by another company at the end of 2025. It is based around neural networks trained for image-to-image translation.
